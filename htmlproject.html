            Final Project made for CAP 3104 - Foundations of HCI <br>
            MindSync was designed to be a website that can be used to help with the mental health of students by helping keep track of assignments and various other things. <br>
            The main skill I learned from this project was very basic HTML, as I had never worked in the language before, but I also learned how crucial it is to determine potential problems with development, as we originally intended for this to be an iPhone app. <br>
