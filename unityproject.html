            Final Project made for CAP 4053 - AI for Game Programming <br>
            Goblin Hold was the Unity game that my group made for CAP 4053, while very unfinished, it was functional enough to earn us a passing grade. <br>
            The main skills that I learned from this project were basic Unity development and project time management. <br>
